# Unity 3d TopDown Zombie Survival rpg game

The game is in a playable state with lots of systems working together. Latest Unity version I tried it in was  2022.3.24f1 LTS

Of course due to licenses and copyrights I cannot include the 3d models and 2d art bought from third parties. These need to be bought and imported individually if you dont want to correctly map the code with placeholder objects and art.
